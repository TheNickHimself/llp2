# WS10: Dummy Client & Server

## Dummy HTTP Client
Extend [dummy_http_client.c](../../week10/dummy_http_client.c) to include the following features:
* Read the URL from command line instead of hardcoded
* Print the following information instead of the entire HTML content:
  * HTTP status returned by server(e.g. 200)
  * Size of the response (e.g. 13232 bytes)
  
## Dummy HTTP Server (optional)
Extend [dummy_http_server.c](../../week10/dummy_http_server.c) to include the following features:
* If the server fails to bind to the port (e.g. another instance running) it should try the next port (old_port+1) until a free port is found and binding succeeds.
* Change ```DUMMY_RESPONSE``` to redirect the browser to a website of your choice.
* When a new client connects print out client information such as IP address and port. Note: this was not covered in the slides hence some research is needed.
