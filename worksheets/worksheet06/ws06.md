# WS06: Stack Overflow

Consider the following code from [stack_test.c](../worksheet06/stack_test.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h> 
void recurse(int level) { 
  char arry[1024]; 
  printf("%d\n", level); 
  recurse(level+1); 
} 
int main(void) { 
  recurse(1); 
  return 0; 
}

```
**Questions**:
* What should happen when you build and execute it?
* Try it out, can you explain the outcome?
* Increase the array size to 10240. Run it again, what changed?
* From this output, can you guess the stack size?

## The default stack size
The default size for the stack on Linux/x86 (32-bit) is 2MB while the default stack size on 64-bit Linux is 8MB (8192 KB).
To check the default size on your system try to run the following command:
```
$ ulimit -a 
core file size          (blocks, -c) 0 
data seg size           (kbytes, -d) unlimited 
scheduling priority             (-e) 0 
file size               (blocks, -f) unlimited 
pending signals                 (-i) 7743 
max locked memory       (kbytes, -l) 64 
max memory size         (kbytes, -m) unlimited 
open files                      (-n) 1024 
pipe size            (512 bytes, -p) 8 
POSIX message queues     (bytes, -q) 819200 
real-time priority              (-r) 0 
stack size              (kbytes, -s) 8192 
cpu time               (seconds, -t) unlimited 
max user processes              (-u) 7743 
virtual memory          (kbytes, -v) unlimited 
file locks                      (-x) unlimited
```

## Changing the size of the stack
It is possible to change the stack size to a value different from the default by using the following command. In this case we are setting it to 4MB (4096KB) which is half of the default:

```$ ulimit â€“s 4096```

Leave the size of the array at 10KB (10240 bytes) and run the program again.

**Questions**:
* What should happen when you execute this time?
* Try it out, does the outcome match what was expected?

*Note: Linux allows users to reduce the stack size but not to increase it. To set the stack size back to the default value of 8MB you need to log off and on again (or restart Linux).*
