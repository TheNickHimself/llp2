# WS01: Revision of C basics

Write C programs to perform the following tasks:
1. Read two numbers from the user. Work out their sum, average and sum of the squares of the numbers.
2. Create a structure to hold details of a person (at least 4 fields). Create a program to read a personâ€™s input and print out the details.
3. Write a program that reads 10 numbers, stores them in an array and print the largest.
4. Increase the value of an int variable in steps of 10000, printing the value every time. What is the max value? What happens when this is passed? 
5. Ask a user to enter a number between 1 and 100. Give error messages if strings or numbers out of range are entered. 
6. Given as input a number of seconds, print the equivalent time in hours, minutes and seconds. Hint: use formatted output.
7. Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. Print out the largest one.
8. Repeat the previous program without using if statements. *Hint: use ternary operator*
9. Use ```srand()``` and ```rand()``` to generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 100
