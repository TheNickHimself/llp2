# WS15: Detecting memory leaks (Optional)

If you want to check if a program has memory leaks, you can us [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/). In this case we will be checking if [curl](https://curl.se/) has any leaks and then trying it on leaky code.

## Step 1: Setup
```
sudo apt install valgrind
sudo apt install curl
```

## Step 2: Run curl by itself
```
$ curl https://mcast.edu.mt
<head><title>Document Moved</title></head>
<body><h1>Object Moved</h1>This document may be found <a HREF="http://www.mcast.edu.mt/">here</a></body>
```

## Step 3: Run valgrind + curl
```
$ valgrind --leak-check=yes curl https://mcast.edu.mt

<head><title>Document Moved</title></head>
<body><h1>Object Moved</h1>This document may be found <a HREF="http://www.mcast.edu.mt/">here</a></body>==14684== 
==14684== HEAP SUMMARY:
==14684==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==14684==   total heap usage: 32,390 allocs, 32,390 frees, 3,152,954 bytes allocated
==14684== 
==14684== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
==14684== 
==14684== For lists of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with: -s
==14684== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

## Step 4: Analysing the result
The curl developers did a great job with avoiding memory leaks, as everything was freed correctly. 
When running curl in this instance 32,390 allocations were done for al total of 3,152,954 bytes allocated.

## Step 5: Trying it on leaky code
Valgrind is especially useful when you run it on your programs and ideally you should use debug binaries (compiled with -O0 and -g). Consider the following code ([leaks.c](./leaks.c)):
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main (void) {
    void *pointers[9];
    pointers[0] = malloc(1024); // this allocation not freed!

    for (int i = 1; i < 9; i++) // alloc 8 buffers
        pointers[i] = malloc(128);

    for (int i = 1; i < 9; i++) 
        free(pointers[i]); // free 8 buffers
    
    return 0;
}
```
Let's see if valgrind finds the leak:

```
$ gcc -Wall -O0 -g leaks.c -o leaks
$ valgrind --leak-check=yes ./leaks
