# WS11: Caps Client & Server

## Client
Write a sockets client program that performs the following steps:
1. Connects to a server(localhost:12345)
2. In an infinite loop:
   * Ask the user to enter a line of text
   * Send it to the server
   * Print out the serverâ€™s response
   * Repeat step 2

Note: make sure you handle all abnormal function return values.

## Caps Single-Threaded Server
Write a sockets server program that performs the following steps:
1. Binds to localhost on port 12345
2. Listens for new client connections
3. When a new client connects:
   * Read the string it is sending
   * Reply with a capitalised version of that string
   * Repeat step 3
  
Note: make sure you handle all abnormal function return values.

## Extra Task
Update your server to only convert requests that start with ```UP:``` such that the following requests produce the corresponding responses:
```
xyz -> xyz
UP:a35 -> A35
UP:hello - HELLO
two words -> two words
UP:QQQQQQ -> QQQQQQ
up:final!test -> up:final!test
```

## Research Task (Optional)
Implement the same client/server above using UDP instead of TCP.
